(*
This specification formally describes the BookKeeper protocol. It describes it
both in prose (in the comments) and formally in TLA+. The scope of the specification
is the lifetime of a single ledger.

Currently not modelled:
- regular reads (including long poll reads), but we have invariants that cover readability.
- Ensemble /= Write Quorum. Striping is not modelled in this spec but the correct cohorts
  for things like fencing and recovery reads are modelled. So adding an explicit ensemble
  size would be possible.

\* Input parameters
CONSTANTS Bookies,                      \* The bookies available e.g. { B1, B2, B3, B4 }
          Clients,                      \* The clients e.g. {c1, c2}
          WriteQuorum,                  \* The replication factor under normal circumstances
          AckQuorum,                    \* The number of bookies that must confirm an entry for the
                                        \* client to acknowledge to its own client, also the minimum
                                        \* replication factor (can occur in scenarios such as ensemble change or ledger closes)
          SendLimit,                    \* The data items to send. Limited to a very small number of data items
                                        \* in order to keep the state space small. E.g 1 or 2
          InflightLimit                 \* Limit the number of unacknowledged add entry requests by the client
                                        \* which can reduce to state space significantly

QuorumCoverage

Quorum coverage is a quorum that is required in two places in the       
protocol:                                                               
 - LAC fencing requests must have been confirmed by enough bookies 
   such that there exists no ack quorum of bookies in the current 
   ledger ensemble that remain unfenced.                                                             
 - An entry is only unrecoverable when there is no ack quorum of bookies 
   of the entry ensemble that have or could confirm they have the entry. 

This can be expressed in different ways:                                
 - There exists no ack quorum of bookies within the cohort that don't    
   satisfy the property.                                                 
 - In every ack quorum of bookies of the cohort, at least one bookie     
   must satisfy the property.                                                       

It can also simply be distilled down to (Cohort size - AckQuorum) + 1  
bookies must satisfy the property.  
For fencing, the cohort is the current fragment ensemble. For recovery
reads, it is the writeset of the entry. The writeset of the entry is
the set of bookies that metadata say must host the bookie. When the ensemble
size = Write Quorum then the writeset = the current ensemble.

The client that created the ledger sends an AddEntryRequestMessage to
each bookie of the current fragment ensemble. The data sent can be an 
arbitrary byte array but in this spec it is simply an integer that 
increases by one on each send, forming a sequence (1,2,3 etc).

Key points:
- Only the client that created the ledger can perform regular writes to it.
- Each request includes the current LAC of the client. The LAC is stored
  alongside the ledger id, entry id and entry body in each bookie.

Key points:
- When the LAC is advanced, it advances to the highest entry that:

- Implicit in this spec is that once the LAC is advanced, any entries it
  passes or reaches is acknowledged back to the caller.

ACTION: A client performs an ensemble change.                           

One or more writes to a bookie has failed and in order for the client 
to be able to continue making progress a new fragment must be created with
replacement bookies for those that had error responses.

In this spec the only write failure is a timeout. Fenced responses do
not cause ensemble changes.
          
The client:                                                             
 - opens a new fragment with a new ensemble, with its first entry id    
   being LAC + 1. Basically all uncommitted entries.
 - the failed bookie is removed from the confirmed set of any 
   non-committed entries. For entries that have Ack Quorum but
   are ahead of the LAC, and therefore not committed, this can 
   reduce them back down to below AckQuorum.
 - if the lowest uncommitted entry id is the same as the current fragment,
   then the current fragment gets overwritten, else a new fragment is
   appended.                                                       
 - If not enough bookies are available to form a new ensemble then writes
   cannot continue. The original client would close the ledger but a recovery
   client would simply abort recovery. This spec does not model this explicitly
   because this spec allows the original client to close the ledger at 
   any time anyway. Likewise, a recovery client can simply stop further 
   interaction with the ledger at any time.         

NOTE: Before triggering another ensemble change, we ensure that all    
      pending add ops that need to be sent to bookies due to a prior   
      ensemble change, do get sent first. This is a state space reduction
      measure.

Key points:
- There will be pending add ops that must now be sent to the replacement
  bookie(s). This is performed in the actions ClientResendsPendingAddOp
  and RecoveryClientSendsPendingAddOp.
- when the original client changes the ensemble, it immediately updates
  the metadata in the metadata store. It cannot progress until the metadata
  is updated.
- when a recovery client changes the ensemble during its read/write phase
  it DOES NOT commit updates to the metadata immediately. Instead it waits until
  the read/write phase is complete and then updates the ensembles when it
  sets the status to CLOSED. Committing metadata changes during recovery is unsafe
  for two reasons:
  1. if recovery fails and needs to be retried, the last fragment will be
     different now and some bookies may never have seen the entries, causing
     ledger truncation.
  2. if two clients attempt recovery concurrently, they can affect each other
     by changing the fragments so they direct recovery reads to bookies that
     were not in the original fragment and therefore cause ledger truncation.

ACTION: Recovery client sends a recovery read request to each bookie.   

A recovery client sends a ReadRequestMessage to each bookie of the    
recovery read ensemble. The client keeps reading until it reaches the
last recoverable entry.                          

Key points:
- The recovery client starts the read/write phase once the bookies that 
  have confirmed they are fenced reaches quorum coverage with the 
  cohort as the current fragment ensemble. See more about quorum coverage
  near the top of the spec.
- It is important to remember that recovery reads get sent to the         
  ensemble of the last fragment ensemble at the time recovery started 
  (called the recovery read ensemble in this spec).
  If reads get sent to the recovery clients current fragment ensemble 
  then ensemble changes resulting from recovery writes can cause reads 
  to be sent to bookies that do not have the entries and the result
  could be ledger truncation.
- recovery read requests also set the fencing flag. This is necessary for
  correctness as the fencing LAC requests only prevent new entries from
  reaching Ack Quorum. Entries that are already half written to the ensemble
  can sneak through if we also don't use fencing on recovery reads.

EXERCISE: Change the fence field in GetRecoveryReadRequests to FALSE to
          see what happens when recovery reads to not fence.

If the entry is unrecoverable, then the read phase is complete and
recovery continues until all recovery writes are complete.         

If all responses for a given entry have been received and still neither

Once all the entries that were read during recovery have been           
successfully written back, recovery is complete. The final action is to
update the metadata:        
 - status to CLOSED                                                      
 - Last Entry id to the highest recovered entry id                       
 - the fragments (which may have changed due to ensemble changes during  
   recovery)
   
Key points:
- The recovery client is only able to close the ledger if the metadata store 
  still has the ledger status as IN_RECOVERY and has the same metadata version 
  as the client. Else the metadata cannot be updated and the recovery is
  aborted.

This invariant is violated if a client were allowed to read an entry

That is simple to prevent, the bookie must simply reject any regular
reads past this point. This spec does not model regular reads.

has indeed reached Ack Quorum and therefore committed.

Ordering is set by the client that writes the data as it sets the entry ids. 
How data is stored is an implementation detail and not relevant to us. 
The point of this invariant is that if a client were to read the entries back,
would they read the data in the same order?
This is achieved by ensuring that the entry id matches the entry body. In this
spec the original client writes to the ledger with entry bodies that are
monotonically increasing like the entry id does.
